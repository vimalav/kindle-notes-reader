# kindle-notes-reader
Python script to read Annotations from Kindle reader and show it as a web page.

Part of my python learning process. I wanted a better way to organize my annotations from Kindle reader. So I created this flow


### kindle-notes-reader.py 
This script to parse the 'My Clippings.txt' file from Kindle and creates separate folder for each book with the highlights.json, book cover etc

### duplicateFinder.py
Filters out the empty fields, duplicates, incomplete highlights. This process is automated upto a limit.
