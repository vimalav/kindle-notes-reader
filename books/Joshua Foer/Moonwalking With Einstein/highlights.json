The reason for the monitored decline in human memory performance is because we actually do anti-Olympic training. What we do to the brain is the equivalent of sitting someone down to train for the Olympics and making sure he drinks ten cans of beer a day, smokes fifty cigarettes, drives to work, and maybe does some exercise once a month that\u2019s violent and damaging, and spends the rest of the time watching television. And then we wonder why that person doesn\u2019t do well in the Olympics. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing with memory.\u201d\n"
