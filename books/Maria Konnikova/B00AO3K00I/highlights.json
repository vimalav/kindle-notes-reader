One system is fast, intuitive, reactionary\u2014a kind of constant fight-or-flight vigilance of the mind. It doesn\u2019t require much conscious thought or effort and functions as a sort of status quo auto pilot. The other is slower, more deliberative, more thorough, more logical\u2014but also much more cognitively costly. It likes to sit things out as long as it can and doesn\u2019t step in unless it thinks it absolutely necessary.\n"
