The fox caught a goose, the wolf caught a fat ram, and the lion caught a scrawny cow. Then it was time to eat. The lion told the wolf to divide their catch. The wolf said, \u2018Let each one take what he has caught: the lion will take the cow, I\u2019ll take the ram, and the fox will take the goose.\u2019 The lion was enraged and, raising his paw, he used his claws to strip the wolf\u2019s head of all its fur and skin. The lion then ordered the fox to divide the spoils. The fox said, \u2018My lord, you should eat as much of the fat ram as you want, since its meat is tender, then you should eat as much of the goose as you want, but you should eat the cow\u2019s flesh only in moderation, since it is so tough. Whatever is left over you can give to us, your servants.\u2019 \u2018Well done,\u2019 said the lion. \u2018Who taught you how to do such a good job of dividing the spoils?\u2019 The fox said, \u2018My lord, I have learned from my associate\u2019s red cap: his excoriated skull provides a very vivid lesson.\u2019\n"
