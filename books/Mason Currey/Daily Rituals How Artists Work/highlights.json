There is a green chaise there if a nap is needed. And in the late afternoon it is often needed.\u201d If she is bored being alone in the studio, Kalman will head to a caf\u00e9 to listen to the buzz of conversation, take the subway to a museum, or go for a walk through Central Park. \u201cI procrastinate just the right amount,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are things which help me get in the mood to work. Cleaning for one. Ironing is great. Taking a walk is always inspiring. Because my work is often based on what I see, I am happy to keep collecting and changing images until the last moment.\u201d Sometimes Kalman doesn\u2019t go into the studio for days at a time. On working days, she is done by 6:00 P.M. She never works at night. \u201cIt\n"
