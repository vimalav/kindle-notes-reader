When people are completely involved in something, they\u2019re not only able to forget their problems, they actually lose track of the passing of time. With further concentration, even the notion of ego or self can disappear. They begin to feel a sense of contentment and the joy of living. The key to flow is the sense of contentment with the passing of time. The consumption of an engrossing movie or TV series may mask the passing of time, but it doesn\u2019t lead to a state of flow. Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s example is the performance of music, but really if you\u2019ve ever been so immersed in doing something complicated that you\u2019ve forgotten everything else, you\u2019ve probably been in a state of flow.\n"
