And, OK, let\u2019s say a proton acts like a tiny magnet, too\u2014one that is much, much, much weaker than an electron. Magnetism is interesting, because as commonplace as it is, it\u2019s one of those rare cases in which we can experiment with quantum phenomena on our own scale. Electrons are, among other things, like tiny magnets with a north pole and a south pole. Depending on an atom\u2019s configuration\u2014specifically, the number of electrons and how they are distributed on the atom\u2014the effects of the tiny magnets may or may not cancel each other out. Each electron creates its own aura of \u201cmagnetic magic,\u201d a magnetic field. A magnetic field is a region in space\u2014very close to the electron, in this case\u2014that can be influenced by this \u201cmagnet.\u201d The combined effects of each electron\u2019s orientation in the atom can sometimes create what we call an atomic magnet, a teeny-tiny magnet. It\u2019s the size of an atom and it\u2019s more than just electrons this time. This time we find ourselves in the company of an atom that forms a little magnetic field around it. This\n"
