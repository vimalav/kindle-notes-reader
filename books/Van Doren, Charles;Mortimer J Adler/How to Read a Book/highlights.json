The packaging of intellectual positions and views is one of the most active enterprises of some of the best minds of our day. The viewer of television, the listener to radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements\u2014all the way from ingenious rhetoric to carefully selected data and statistics\u2014to make it easy for him to \u201cmake up his own mind\u201d with the minimum of difficulty and effort. But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and \u201cplays back\u201d the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.\n"

Reading and listening are thought of as receiving communication from someone who is actively engaged in giving or sending it.\n"

Finally, the distinction between instruction and discovery (or between aided and unaided discovery) is important because most of us, most of the time, have to read without anyone to help us. Reading, like unaided discovery, is learning from an absent teacher. We can only do that successfully if we know how.\n"
